<p class="statement">Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the
same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in $8n^2$ steps, while merge
sort runs in 64n lg n steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge
sort?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>
Solving the inqeuality $8*n^2 > 64*n*lgn$ will tell us how large $n$ must be such
that insertion sort will take longer to complete.
</p>
<p>
$$8n^2 > 64nlgn | / 8n, n \gt 0$$
$$n > 8lgn | - 8lgn$$
$$n - 8lgn > 0$$
<p>
The smallest integer for which the inequality holds is 43.
