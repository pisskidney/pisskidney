How can we modify almost any algorithm to have a good best-case running time?
</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Assuming the problem statement refers to sorting algorithms, checking if the
array is already sorted?</p>
<p>That would yield a best-case running time of $\Theta(n)$ for any sorting algorithm.</p>
